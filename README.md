Part 2: Thread Synchronization – The Study Room Problem
Description: Study Room Problem
A study room on campus can accommodate two types of students: computer
science majors and biology majors. Computer science majors and biology
majors share a common room to study. However, the room should never
contain a mix of biology and computer science students. If there are any
computer science majors in the room, then no biology majors can enter and
vice versa. Also, since the room is not very large, it can only accommodate
up to five students. Therefore, if the room is full, students wishing to enter
must wait, regardless of major.
Once granted access to the study room, each computer science student will
perform the following tasks in order:
1) Enter room
2) Sit on a couch
3) Study for a certain amount of time
4) There is an Xbox in the study room. They will play on the Xbox for a
certain amount of time
5) Pack up bookbag
6) Exit room
After accessing the study room, each biology student will do the following in
order:
1) Enter room
2) Sit on a couch
3) Study for a certain amount of time
4) Eat a snack
5) Pack up bookbag
6) Exit room
Your Task
You will create a multithreaded Java program to coordinate the tasks among
computer science and biology students. You must implement proper
synchronization with semaphores. Also, you must have appropriate output
statements for each task performed by each student. For example, consider
the following example output for 10 CS students and 10 biology students. In
this example, there are never more than 5 students in the room and there’s
never a mix of CS and biology majors.

Once you have finished implementing proper synchronization, test your
program using 20 computer science students and 20 biology students.
Requirements
 For both biology and computer science majors in tasks 3 and 4, the
student threads will wait momentarily (using the Thread.Sleep
method).
 Your threads must be properly synchronized. There should be no
race conditions, deadlock, or other unexpected output due to
improper synchronization.
 Do not be overly restrictive. Multiple students can use the study
room simultaneously if the stated restrictions are adhered to.
